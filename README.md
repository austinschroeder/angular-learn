# Task-Tracker: A Project in Angular

Task-Tracker is a simple, yet powerful project designed to help you keep track of your tasks. It was built using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4, with the primary objective of improving my understanding of the Angular framework, its methodologies and best practices.

This project uses:

- **CRUD operations** with a locally setup backend using JSON-server.
- The **Angular Router** for smooth page transitions.
- Styling and icons from **fortawesom/angular-font-awesome v6** for a modern UI.

**Features:**

- Easy tracking of tasks with changeable reminder indicators.
- Persistent data across page refreshes.
